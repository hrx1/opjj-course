# What is this?

This repository contains homeworks and solutions from course _Osnove programskog jezika Java_ (aka _Čupićeva java_) lectured by prof. dr. sc. Marko Čupić in the 2017-2018 academic year. **Students were given mostly 4, but up to 6, days to complete each homework**. Homeworks and their auxilary files are given in `tekstovi_zadataka` directory, but solutions are in `hw*` directories.

## Short description of given homeworks

Most interesting (in my opinion) homeworks are bolded. All of them used **Maven** as build tool, and few of them used **Tomcat**. Homeworks were solved with OOP principles and **design patterns** in mind.

Each **homework contained more tasks then described below**. Only most important (in my opinion) tasks are stated. **JUnit tasks** were mandatory for each homework, just as reviewing code of my colleagues.

 - hw01 - implementation of a Tree
 - hw02 -  implementation of resizable array-backed collection, stack, **language processor (parser) for defined document model**
 - hw03 - **Lexical and semantical analyser** of defined language
 - hw04 - Lib for vectors, **Turtle drawing app, Drawing Lindermeyer fractals with Turtle drawing app**
 - hw05 - hashtable, **simple database with it's query language** (filters)
 - hw06 - observer pattern with emulated sensors, prime number generation, multistack with stream (**lambdas, method referencing and anonymous method**)

 - hw08 - Improving shell from hw07 with pwd, cd, pushd, popd, listd, cptree and **massrename** commands. Massrename command takes **regex** (parsed **from scratch**).
 - hw09 - lib for vectors and complex rooted polynomials, drawing Mandelbrot fractal with multithreaded computation, **Raytracing with Phong model from scratch**
